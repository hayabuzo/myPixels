This program sums the pixels of an image and calculates the median values for **lightness, detail, saturation**. Depending on the distribution of these values in the image, the program suggests cropping options to balance the composition.

## Settings

**Lightness calculation mode** ‚Äî different options for calculating lightness, which will lead to different total balance values of light spots and image details.

**Balance / Histogram / Crop** ‚Äî turn on/off visualisation for each value on the preview.

**Resolution** ‚Äî the higher the resolution of the calculations, the more accurate the result, and the longer the processing.

**Preview Mode** ‚Äî the channel that will be displayed in the preview window.

**Value - Amount - Balance** ‚Äî amount of value (% of a completely white image) and balance relative to the geometric middle of the image ("+" is deviation to the right, "-" is to the left, % of image width).

**Processing** ‚Äî options for crop according to the values and for saving.
